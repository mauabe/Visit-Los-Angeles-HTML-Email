# Visit Los Angeles HTML-Email

![Visit Los Angeles HTML Email](visit-los-angeles.jpg)

A picture perfect html email, build with tables and nested tables. Just like in 1999. 

A lot of email readers do not support HTML5 and features like `<div>` or `<h1>`, so we have to rely on `<span>`, `<table>`, `<tr>` and `<td>`, and lots of inline styling.
